### What is wPOKT?

Wrapped POKT (wPOKT) is an Ethereum ERC-20 token backed 1:1 by POKT.

### What are the benefits of wPOKT?

By having a representation of POKT in the Ethereum ecosystem, we enable:

- the interoperability of Pocket Network with best-in-class DeFi and DAO tooling and infrastructure
- improved liquidity and access to POKT

Enabling these benefits has the potential to unlock financial legos, such as streaming payments, DAO budgeting, and other integrations that will help the DAO to scale and onboard new contributors. Additionally, wPOKT as a programmatic primitive can be the foundation for more sophisticated Pocket products in the future.

### How does wPOKT maintain 1:1 value with POKT?

While the price for wPOKT may diverge from the price of POKT from time to time, as a result of market pressures on supply and demand wherever wPOKT and POKT are each traded - for example, on Uniswap for wPOKT and Gate/Kucoin for POKT - you will always be able to swap each wPOKT token for one POKT token, and vice-versa. This is because to mint wPOKT, POKT is first locked in the bridge vault and the corresponding amount of wPOKT is minted, so that the wPOKT token supply exactly equals the number of locked POKT. When wPOKT is swapped back for POKT, the wPOKT is burned, maintaining the 1:1 relationship.
