## Written Guide to wrapping $POKT

For this tutorial, we'll use a Ledger Nano S for POKT and MetaMask for the wPOKT. Alternative options for POKT include SendWallet and NodeWallet (read more [here](https://docs.pokt.network/pokt/wallets/)).

1. Go to [http://wpokt.network](http://wpokt.network) and connect your Pocket Wallet using your Ledger.

2. Then, connect your Ethereum Wallet, weâ€™re using MetaMask.

   Once connected, you should see both your POKT and wPOKT (if any) balances.

3. Time to wrap some POKT! If youâ€™re experienced you may feel comfortable wrapping a larger amount, but we recommend testing with a smaller amount.
    
    Input the amount of POKT you want to wrap. Click â€˜Wrapâ€™ and follow the prompt to sign and approve the transaction on your ledger.

4. Transactions (Txs) on the POKT network take up to 15 minutes to confirm, so we wait. ðŸ§˜

5. After that, the transaction enters the bridge mode, which takes another 5-10 minutes. We keep waiting. ðŸ§˜

{{% notice style="note" %}} If you accidentally (or purposefully) close the page, simply reconnect both wallets (using the same applications). Youâ€™ll be prompted to complete the process where you left off. {{% /notice %}}

6. Your wrapped POKT (wPOKT) will be confirmed via [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) once the process is complete.

### Adding wPOKT Token Contract to your MetaMask Wallet

Youâ€™ll need to add the Token contract address to your Metamask wallet if it doesnâ€™t import automatically:`0x67F4C72a50f8Df6487720261E188F2abE83F57D7`
